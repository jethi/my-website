# Gemini is Awesome

## So, what is Gemini ?

Gemini is a protocol just like HTTP and Gopher. Provides more features than Gopher and less features than HTTP. Focus on simplicity, privacy and generality. I strongly recommend reading more about it at the official source.

## Why I like it ?

I discovered Gemini yesterday and the most exciting thing for me was how simple it was to understand the working under the hood.

A working client in 100 lines of code and a TLS library ? It is amazing for introducing students to an internet protocol.

That's all folks. Cheers
